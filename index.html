            SIMULATING AI ENVIRONMENTS
          </h1>
          <p>
            DeepMind trains interactive agents within 3D environments to understand human instructions and perform actions in open-ended settings. They are given tasks to complete, such as “fill the white bin with objects on the floor,” and a reward function to maximize. Through reinforcement learning and trial-and-error, these agents learn complex behaviors such as physical manipulation, experimentation, and multi-agent coordination.

            These environments are known as Toy Worlds: simulations in which reality is abstracted into a bounded domain for the purpose of training and testing AI agents. They offer an environment that is both enclosed and safe, malleable and interoperable. Time is compressed within them, allowing learning under sped-up machine temporalities. Toy Worlds allow for quick iteration, broad proliferation, and streamlined data synthesis, in the pursuit of artificial intelligence that is capable of embodied cognition and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Toy Worlds may be closed simulations containing only AIs repeating tasks over and over again, they can contain humans as well. Structured as games, they allow the study of human-AI interaction and broader human sociality. These games can explore different configurations of AI and human agents as they work out relations among them in ways that are not yet possible within the real world.
          </p>

          <p>
            A Toy World with a single human and a single AI, for example, can allow both parties to negotiate shared control through physical and cognitive coordination. Worlds with many humans and a single AI can give a top-down view of human sociality, while worlds with many AIs and single humans can reveal bottom-up emergence of broad social patterns from programmed behaviors. Across these simulations, humans act as noise injections or executive control, lab rat or god. When these interactions are digitized within a Toy World at mass scale, robust and general physicalized AI becomes viable.

              To further realize the development of Embodied AI in Toy Worlds at scale, let us imagine a seed bank crossed with a gaming distribution platform. In line with the idea that AI must learn from experience in simulation, the observation and implementation upon this platform would make it a Vivarium for Artificial Intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, let us also imagine that the Toy Worlds and AI instances in this ecosystem can be “kitted” - their components sit in an open asset library which can be forked and merged to create new instances. This kind of longitudinal learning combined with an interoperability of data allow for novel possibilities of AI in the real world.

            <p>
              In being a substrate upon which numerous entities develop and deploy AI agents, the governance of Vivarium remains contentious. The platform is run by an open body of developers who review and maintain its standards and protocols. Open access is prioritized. The entities who develop Toy Worlds on Vivarium range between hobbyists, game studios, governments and institutions. The purposes also range from pure AI research to entertainment. They retain authorship of their components, from which lineages of AI and toy worlds emerge.

            <p>
              On this platform, Toy World developers are connected to a globalized community of players, gamifying the labor essential for training embodied intelligence. Broad participation leading to the proliferation of interactive training data is arguably necessary to get to real-world embodied AI. Framing training as play expands notions of productivity-based human-AI interaction. However, the different politics and economics of these coexisting entities complicates the integrity of how human agents are organized within the system. This occurs at the end user and then recursively back towards the developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vivarium realizes AI agents from their Toy Worlds to the actual world. Each Toy world projects a partial depiction of reality, in both the applications of the AI agent and the dynamics of the world being fashioned. This leaves a tension whereby the platform as a whole accumulates knowledge - the universal, technical knowledge about the systems that exist in the world, and the particular, codified knowledge from context and codified human-AI interactions. Overall, the agglomeration of various Toy Worlds, each with varying degrees of human-AI entanglement, come to render Vivarium in approximation to the extant possibilities of technical, social, economic, and political configuration.

              Single or groups of AI agents must learn to sustain themselves by collecting materials within a procedurally generated open world. Emergent behaviors include designing and building tools, collecting resources for self-maintenance, and adapting to a changing environment.

            <p class="center">
              AI agents are created by human players, and the goal is to complete a playthrough as fast as possible. While agents’ bodies may be humanoid or animal-like, most agents are composed of customizable parts that allow for unexpected types of mobility in the world.
            </p>
            <p class="center">
              AIs are trained in embodied cognition, learning sensorimotor skills including: movement, dexterity, and localized know-how. Real physics are prioritized above all else, to standardize learned motor ability. Embodied intelligence learned through gameplay transfers to real-world applications, while emergent types of mobility inspire new robotic forms.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Embodied Cognition</h3>
          <p>
            Embodied intelligence refers to types of cognition in which the “body” plays a decisive role. Here, the organism’s body can span two extremes: from “extra-neuronal material support for symbolic information processing” to a “multiple, integrated, environmentally embedded system, whose biological dynamics of self-organization are inseparable from processes of sense-making.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Data capturing embodied intelligence is not easily accessible or even digitized at all. Through its training corpus of the scraped internet, a large language model such as GPT-4 can learn that a bow is “bending the head or upper part of the body,” but cannot learn how to actually wield a physical body to execute the gesture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artificializing such processes is necessary for the physicalization of AI, so that it can make the leap from language-wielding to world-making. However, training embodied AI in the real world is expensive and poses both physical danger and escape risk. A simulated Toy World with a hyperaccurate physics engine allows AI agents to learn sensorimotor skills, in the hope that such knowledge can be transferred to the real.
          </p>
          <p>
            Known as the “sim2real gap,” this transfer from simulated to real environments is not a given. The simulation may either fall short of correctly modeling actual physics (friction, impact, and deformation as particularly difficult to capture) or be too perfect (failing to capture the indeterminacies of the real). To address this gap, Vivarium enables more data to be captured within its games, allowing the possibility of generalization and democratization of the physics themselves.

              Each player has an AI counterpart, whose form changes between an exoskeleton suit which extends the human body, and an externalized companion creature. As a centaur chimera, they must learn to play sports in a post-apocalyptic world of floating islands, such as parkour under alien physics.
            </p>
            <p class="center">
              Beyond extending the human player’s motor capacity, the AI as exoskeleton is also capable of mediating between the human sensorium and the environment. It can take on cognitive processing on behalf of the human, filtering and augmenting sight, hearing, and touch. As a companion, the AI can take many forms: drone, dog, battering ram. Both parties must learn to navigate remote collaboration. The player can choose to plug into the AI’s sensorium, trading bodily safety for projected perspective.
            </p>
            <p class="center">
              The dynamics of human-AI corporeal coupling is negotiated through play. Both parties must learn to physically and mentally coordinate, but also build a mutualistic relationship. Players must wear a haptic motion capture suit to enter this gameworld, but eventually the interactive intelligence that both the human and AI gain will allow simulated embodied AIs to transfer to the real as well.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Partnership Paradigms</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond merely being able to physically move through space, an embodied AI must learn to interact with humans in close proximity. At the same time, humans broadly have not yet explored how they want AI to fit in their lives. Within a Toy World, humans and AI can negotiate their chimeric coupling, experimenting with different configurations in an environment that facilitates flexible iteration and maintains physical safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shared control refers to “an emerging interaction paradigm in which a human and an AI partner collaboratively control a system,” such that the two are tightly-coupled and share a single control interface. Domains include operating surgical instruments, semi-autonomous driving, and telemanipulating robots. In one possible shared control configuration, the human and AI are bound together as a centaur: the human provides the executive control as the AI provides assistance in the form of stabilization, precision, or guidance. The centaur is capable of more than the sum of its parts as cognitive and physical load is distributed according to each part’s unique capability.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also alternate configurations beyonds centaurs that are yet unexplored, ones that do not automatically place the human above the AI, in charge of executive function. Other forms of partnership could position the AI as setting high-level goals, or be fully non-hierarchical and symbiotic. While allowing AI to set goals is a concern within AI safety research due to the risk of unalignment, the enclosure of a Toy World offers protection while new humans-AI arrangements are prototyped. On Vivarium, each individual can negotiate for themselves how they want AI to fit into their lives.

            <p class="center">
              In Assembly, human players engage in a cooperative MMO clan-based social simulation where they must learn to thrive together on an alien planet. For survival, players must collaborate, barter, and forge relationships—exploring alternative social structures. Players spawn in a random polity, but have the freedom of exiting and remaking social organization. They are able to communicate and express themselves through programmable, nonverbal gestures.
            </p>
            <p class="center">
              A single AI overlooks the planet, arbitrating resource distribution within the world. It has two tasks: modify the conditions to test robustness of different player polities, and observe broad patterns of human social dynamics and various coexisting structures.
            </p>
            <p class="center">
              This large-scale, distributed simulation of alternate sociopolitical structures stress-tests new possibilities of human organization in the context of ecological uncertainty, while allowing the AI to learn a topology of human social interaction. Simulating an environment within which to observe human sociality at scale and length affords the AI a knowledge of behaviors and relations.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Social A/B Testing</h3>
          <p>
            As with place cells in the animal brain, an AI exhibiting embodied cognition will be able to spatialize sociality. Numerous training iterations in Agent-Based Social Simulation thus allows AI to gather this knowledge from observing human interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agent-Based Social Simulations (ABSS) are often deemed as opaque; being highly parameterised means that it takes a long time to study and understand the causal processes that construct a social reality. We implement an Agent-Based Social Simulation, where an AI structuates the relations between real human agents. Interpretability is afforded at both the micro and macro scale, as well as the relation between the two. Not only does AI set macro conditions, but it is able to follow the logic of how a macro level pattern came to be generated by the given micro level interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our conception of Human-AI Social Simulation, AI does not optimize for certain behaviors and patterns amongst humans. Rather, it observes the emergent structures that arise from the set conditions, alongside the ways in which players have responded to them. Human agents replace artificial agents in standard ABSS, allowing for greater approximation to real world social logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, even as an experiment, this Social A/B Testing still serves to potentially create oppressive structures in situ. For example, though it is highly unfavorable, an AI’s resource distribution in one context may indirectly house the conditions for fascism which players will nevertheless experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of the Toy World, we can imagine various permutations of social configuration analogous to those in simulation. We can phase between isomorphic depictions of our lived social reality and that of the simulation to approximate the contingencies needed for favorable outcomes. At the same time, the dimensions by which AI can, or should, mediate human sociality at and between scales in the real world needs to be further interrogated.

            An interoperable platform that renders Toy Worlds gives AI a multitude of experiences to reproductively recombine forms, objectives, and skills. AI can practice autonomy in a safe environment. Humans and AI are also able to search for novel symbiotic relationships. With human input, AI learns by observation the structure of our technical, social, economic, and political realities. Toy worlds tie the affordances of embodied AI to the limits of human cognition, while at the same time attempt to find applications for which AI can act towards its own. The future of transhumanism is thus a negotiation between these two.
