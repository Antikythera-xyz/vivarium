                <h2>CogNets (Cognitive Networks)</h2><br>
                <p>
                    Once agents are equipped with individual motor skills, they practice multi-agent coordination as cognitive networks, or CogNets, within toy worlds populated by many AIs. Agents are not cognitively discrete from one another as humans are: they can transmit lossless snapshots of mental states or “see” through the photoreceptors of another. Boundaries delineating networked agents are blurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tasks can include monitoring endangered species across large areas or assembling industrial machinery in close quarters. Swarms learn to distribute cognition and communicate. Some have members equipped with different senses, requiring creative signaling to span different umwelts. Other worlds inhibit inter-agent communication entirely, forcing stigmergic coordination. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, CogNets appear to behave as singular organisms. Agents operate at different scales; larger agents may even have “organs” composed of smaller ones. This nesting of cognition makes intelligence scaffolding and abiotic evolution possible, as agents recompose themselves of intelligent parts. These toy worlds lay the foundation for a planet populated by many minds at many scales.
