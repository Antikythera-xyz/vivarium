                <h3>Sensorimotor Suite</h3><br>
                <p>Sensorimotor suites contain hyper-accurate physics and mimic the real as closely as possible. Through
                    fulfilling tasks within training loops run at accelerated time, individual AI agents learn the
                    basics of embodiment: gross and fine motor skills, identifying objects, and interacting with
                    environments.</p>
                <p>
                    The collective intelligence of human players is harnessed for developing worlds and training agents.
                    Interoperable components for building sensorimotor simulations are available on the asset store;
                    these include physically detailed objects and procedurally-generated layouts, but also well-defined
                    tasks for agents to fulfill and benchmarks to measure their performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players can also assemble agents from different “parts,” giving them varied forms, sensoriums, and
                    skill suites. As agents improve, toy worlds challenge them with changing conditions, requiring
                    aerial or amphibious capabilities. Certain game rules constrain player resources, motivating them to
                    develop agents with optimal physical forms and minimum viable sensoriums for niche tasks.
